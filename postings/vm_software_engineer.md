patches and upgrades to existing systems. Ensures coding is free of known coding
flaws and weak design approaches, and checks software to identify and remediate
flaws. Recognizes security vulnerabilities in programs while under time,
quality, or cost pressures/constraints. Addresses means to reduce exploitable
software weaknesses and improve capabilities to routinely develop, acquire, and
deploy resilient software products. Enables software security automation and
measurement capabilities through use of common indexing and reporting
capabilities for malware, exploitable software weaknesses, vulnerabilities,
structured threat information, cyber observables, and common attacks which
target software; enhances software transparency and security diagnostic and
measurement capabilities.

**Systems Administrator**:  Installs, configures, troubleshoots, and maintains
server configurations (hardware and software) to ensure their confidentiality,
integrity, and availability. Responsible for access control, passwords, account
creation and administration. Develops and documents systems administration
standard operating procedures; resolves hardware/software interface and
interoperability problems. Ensures systems availability, functionality,
integrity, and efficiency; maintains systems configuration; manages the
installation and integration of system fixes, updates, and enhancements. Also
manages accounts, firewalls, and patches.

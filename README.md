### Vulnerability Management software engineering team ###

A small shop with a big heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è We're looking for both junior and senior
developers to help design the tools and systems used by CISA's Vulnerability
Management sub-division.  These are the folks that perform many of our
[cybersecurity assessments](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-resource-hub).

Our development team is responsible for a majority of the repositories in the
[cisagov organization](https://github.com/cisagov). Take a look around to get a
sense of what we are currently working on.  Recently we've been making a big
push to cloudify all the things, resulting in our new
[COOL](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-system) system. You'll find a good deal
of Python, infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible, Packer), and old-school
shell scripting.

We're big fans of [open development in
government](https://digital.gov/communities/open-source/) and promote it
whenever we can.

We appreciate that software development can be an art as much as a science.  Bob
Ross got to pick his own brushes, and so can you!  There are very few
restrictions on what you can craft as your development environment. (But you may
get razzed if registry keys are involved.)

If have any questions for our team, please feel free to join the conversation
over in the [Guild of
Developers](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/discussions).

Adventure awaits!  Huzzah! ü§∫
